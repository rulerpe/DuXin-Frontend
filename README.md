<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was inspired by my dad, a senior immigrant who is not tech-savvy and not proficient in English. People like him have a significant need to understand their mail letters. That's why I created Duxin, a letter translator and summarizer. Duxin is an intuitive application designed to help non-tech-savvy seniors and non-English speakers effortlessly understand their mail in their native language.

The app was built with a mobile-first approach, recognizing that it's more convenient to take photos with a phone. However, there is also an option to upload images from local files, ensuring versatility and accessibility for all users.

## Features

- **Instant Mail Scanning:** Utilize your device's camera to capture a picture of the mail letter you wish to understand. This feature leverages [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) for OCR technology, extracting text directly from the image for processing.

- **Automated Summary:** Provide a concise summary of the letter's contents, highlighting essential information at a glance. This is achieved by using [LangChain](https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb) to construct prompts that are then processed by the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), ensuring a high-quality summary.

- **Accurate Translation:** Receive translations of the summarized content into your native language, facilitating understanding without the barrier of language. This function combines the capabilities of [LangChain](https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb) with the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) for reliable and precise translations.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, featuring a large font and clear instructions to guide users through each step. Simplifying the signup process, users only need a phone number to register, utilizing the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/user-authentication-identity/verify) for OTP (One-Time Password) verification.

## How it Works
1. **Language Selection:** The app automatically detects your browser's language setting for immediate convenience, with the option to manually select a different language if desired.
2. **Scan:** Utilize your device's camera to scan the physical mail letter you wish to understand.
3. **Summarize:** The app then processes the scanned image to extract text, generate a summary.
4. **Translate:** Automatically translated into chosen language.
5. **Read:**  The translated summary is displayed on your screen for easy reading.
- **optional:** Sign up with just your phone number to track and manage your summary history.

**Note:** Signup functionality leverages OTP verification via Twilio and is currently a work in progress. However, you can sign in with a test account to explore this feature. Use the test phone number: 1234567890, and test OTP code: 123456 for access.
